CPU-Intensive Tasks (Heavy Computation)
These tasks rely on the processor's computational power and are often bottlenecked by CPU speed.

Data Processing & Computation

Large-scale matrix operations (e.g., in NumPy, TensorFlow)
Cryptographic computations (hashing, encryption, decryption)
Image processing (filters, transformations, feature extraction)
Video encoding/decoding
Compression (ZIP, GZIP, etc.)
Algorithm Execution

Sorting large datasets (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)
Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A*)
Graph traversal (DFS, BFS)
Computational geometry (Convex hull, Voronoi diagrams)
Machine learning model training (especially deep learning)
Simulations & Modeling

Physics simulations (fluid dynamics, particle systems)
Financial modeling and Monte Carlo simulations
Genetic algorithms
Game AI (pathfinding, decision trees)
Rendering & Graphics Processing

3D rendering (ray tracing, rasterization)
Game physics (collision detection, physics engines)
Shader calculations (GPU-heavy but CPU can bottleneck)
